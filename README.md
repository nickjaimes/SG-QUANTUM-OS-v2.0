## 🔷 SG QUANTUM OS — Architecture Overview

SG QUANTUM OS is a hybrid-intelligence operating framework combining:
- **AI autonomy**
- **Human-in-the-loop safety**
- **Distributed sensing**
- **Policy-driven orchestration**
- **Security-first execution**

This enables real-time defense, rapid decision-making,
and unified orchestration across devices, networks, and cloud.

### 🔹 Subsystem Navigation

| Subsystem | Description | Link |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| TRINITY   | Central orchestrator coordinating agents, policies, actions | `docs/TRINITY/INTERNALS.md` |
| HIMS      | Hybrid intelligence management + security governance | `docs/HIMS/INTERNALS.md` |
| DeepSeek  | Pattern modeling + forecasting + anomaly detection | `docs/DEEPSEEK/INTERNALS.md` |
| Eagle-Eye | Multi-dimensional sensing + signal intelligence | `docs/EAGLE_EYE/PIPELINE.md` |

## ✅ Human–AI Collaboration Philosophy

SG QUANTUM OS is designed around **Human Trust + AI Scale**, where:

| AI Provides | Human Provides |
|-------------|----------------|
| Fast reasoning | Ethical judgment |
| Pattern recognition | Context |
| Continuous monitoring | Strategic direction |
| Self-optimization | Mission intent |
| Predictive intelligence | Moral authority |

This creates a **virtuous loop**:
> AI observes → models → proposes → Human validates → AI executes → logs → refines

Ensuring safety, transparency, and alignment.
